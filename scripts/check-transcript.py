"""Prove the committed transcript belongs to the film it claims to transcribe.

    ./scripts/check-transcript.py recordings/lp8-demo.srt <film.mp4>

A transcript shipped next to a video is a convenience, and a convenience nobody
checks is a claim nobody checks. This asserts three things, and none of them is
"the file exists":

  STRUCTURE   cues are numbered from 1, strictly ordered, never overlapping, and
              the last one ends inside the film rather than past its end. A
              transcript of a *different*, longer cut fails here.

  FIT         the last cue ends within TAIL seconds of the film's end. A
              transcript of the first half of the film passes every structural
              check ever written and is still the wrong transcript.

  ANCHORS     the narration is spoken, so it is not on screen — but what it
              talks about is. For each anchor below, the frame at the moment the
              line is spoken must show the matching text. That is what ties the
              words to the picture, and it is the only check here that could not
              be satisfied by a plausible file written from memory.

No skip path: a missing ffmpeg, ffprobe or tesseract exits non-zero. A checker
that passes when it cannot look is the failure it exists to prevent.
