    ./scripts/check-no-cross-submission.py

WHY THIS EXISTS

This repository is one submission. A reviewer reading it should find the thing
it is about and nothing else — not the identifier of a different prize entry,
not a competing bid, not a note about how some other submission was received.
That is a judgement about what belongs in a deliverable, and it is not the kind
of thing anyone notices while writing code.

It has already been wrong here. `scripts/check-transcript.py` shipped an anchor
table with an entry for three different films, two of them belonging to other
submissions, and their filenames sat in the source for anyone who opened the
script. Nothing flagged it, because the only check that looks for this lived in
one repository out of three and had never been run.

WHAT IT LOOKS FOR

Identifiers of other prize entries, and the vocabulary of comparison. The
patterns are deliberately blunt: a false positive costs one line of reading, and
a miss costs a reviewer finding a competitor's name in a file that is supposed
to be about this work.

WHAT IT DOES NOT DO

Judge intent. `LP-0019` in a sentence about future work is caught here and has
to be looked at, because a script cannot tell a roadmap from a leak. When a
mention is deliberate, say so in EXPECTED below with the reason, so the next
person reads the reason instead of re-deciding.
